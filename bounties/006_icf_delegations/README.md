  This is an exercise in keeping public institutions accountable.
  Use publicly verifiable information to track the current AND historic delegations of the ICF.
  Any code and data must be well organized, commented, and easy to grok.
  Create a table of historic and current delegators, and their identities and respective owners.
  Unspecified number of ATOMs and GNOTs depending on difficulty.
  PAYMENT: pending, will be updated here when done.
